Just some interesting findings of my course project.

I trained an MLP to fit a single measured BRDF, and I conducted some simple comparisons with the results from the paper 'A Compact Representation of Measured BRDFs Using Neural Processes,' available at https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3490385.

The values of the slices showed that my BSDF results are much stronger than theirs, but there wasn't much change in the actual rendering process. The influence of the cosine term is really powerful.
